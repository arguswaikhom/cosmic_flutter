# Cosmic Flutter
Cosmic Flutter is a galley of open-source Flutter applications. All the application(s) in this app are publicly available and are free to use. Apps in the Cosmic Flutter are useable right away inside the Cosmic Flutter app itself.

Currently, all the applications in the Cosmic Flutter are developed by me. But if you have a design and want to contribute, pull requests are more than welcome.
